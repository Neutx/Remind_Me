# Remind_Me

RemindME, an Android application designed to help you remember important tasks and events. This app is the implementation of the idea presented in our accompanying paper, which proposes a smart reminders app enhanced with advanced features.
Our app offers a simple and user-friendly interface that allows you to create reminders for specific dates and times, set repeat intervals for recurring tasks, and set custom notifications to remind you when a task is due. You can also organize your reminders into different categories to stay on top of all your tasks.
With RemindME, you'll never miss an important meeting, deadline, or birthday again. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to using the app, including step-by-step instructions for its features and troubleshooting tips for any issues you may encounter. We hope you find this app useful and welcome any feedback you may have.
